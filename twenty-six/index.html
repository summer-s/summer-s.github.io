    <p>You have such big feet. They make size 8.5s look like little princess foots. So, you know, thanks for that.</p>

    <p>So supportive. I've gone through a lot health-wise in the months we've been together, but you've always had my back.</p>

    <p>You want to show me off. Friends, family, coworkers, passerbys, no one is safe. I'm your prized catch, and everyone is going to know.</p>

    <p>I learn so much from you. Science stuff, Philly stuff, cooking stuff, adult stuff, podcast stuff, so much more stuff. My own personal life coach.</p>

    <p>The way you get so ticklish. I can't even stand it. I just want to run outside to Clark Park and pluck a pigeon's feather and carress you with it. Too cute.</p>
</div>
<div class="col span_1_of_4">

    <p>You let me be me. Even if that means letting me squalk my feelings down the sidewalk and embarrassing us both. I just feel so free when I'm with you.</p>

    <p>My model. So fashion. So style. I love that you probably know more about fashion than I do. And I'm obviously basically a Vogue magazine editor.</p>

    <p>We don't always have to be out doing something. You're happy just staying in with me (within limits) and doing whatever it is we do in that apartment. So chill.</p>

    <p>You're already surprisingly transparent to me for someone I've only known for a few months. I like that I can read you so easily. Can't hide from this amiga. *eye emoji*</p>

    <p>You communicate so well, and you make me feel comfortable enough to tell you pretty much anything. I know we'll only get better and better at effectively expressing ourselves.</p>

    <p>Feminist noodle. I know we're not supposed to give men a pat on the back for being "decent" but... /pats. It's not like you're doing the bare minimum, either. You're dedicated to learning and growing. </p>

    <p>We're basically the same person with a few minor tweaks. Enough tweaks to keep it interesting and allow us to learn from each other, but enough sameness that we sort of understand how the other thinks.</p>

    <p>It's so refreshing to have a guy who actually cares about his appearance. I might tease you, but I secretly love the fact that you own more than one hair product. Or that you own any at all. Amazing.</p>
</div>
<div class="col span_1_of_4">

    <p>It makes me so happy when you tease me about my "accent" and mannerisms. I really cherish the fact that we can tease each other the way we do.</p>

    <p>Your total and complete lack of chill is so endearing. I'm so glad I've never had to hide my lack of chill either, not that I could if I tried.</p>

    <p>The way you look at me. The way you look at smol animals. The way you see little things other people would miss, whether that's a $20 bill or a bird's egg. Those eyes are so kind and so observant. </p>

    <p>You want so badly to be better, and you try so hard. Your hard work is going to pay off, and soon the difficult times will be just a blip on the radar. Hang in there, I'm with you.</p>
