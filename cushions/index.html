            <p>One cushion turned into six, with more on the way. Why? Because once you go cushion, you won't go back. I was determined to find the best cushion for my oily skin and I for under $20, and thanks to my cushion addiction, I finally have (for now, at least). <br><br><strong>Ready to take a look?

                    <h4>Long Wear Cushion</h4>
                    <h5>$17</h5>
                    <p class="review-para">Ah, my first cushion. It was love at first pat. I've since found a cushion that works better for me, as you'll read later on. However, if a matte finish is what you want, it doesn't seem to get much better than this cushion. As you can imagine, it's great for oily skin, not so great for dry skin. I don't like the puff much either; it's not soft enough to handle the sticky formula. As you pat it on, you may find that you're also patting it off, causing it to look patchy. I regularly use one of my softer puffs (A'pieu) to apply it, which infinitely improves the finish. In spite of its faults, it's a solid cushion if you have oily skin.</p>

                    <h4>Magic M Cushion</h4>
                    <h5>$5</h5>
                    <p class="review-para">This cushion was quite cheap (which is the main reason I ended up trying it out), but it's a fairly good deal, depending on your skin type. If you want a glow, you'll get it. If you want your cushion to last over 3-4 hours and you have oily skin, you might be a bit disappointed. Its coverage is pretty good though, erasing any mild redness or discoloration with ease. I don't wear this if I know I'll be out of the house for 5+ hours because it won't survive. However, because of its price and general okayness, it's one of only two of these cushions I will continue to buy refills for. What's the other? Read on, my friends, read on.</p>

                    <h5>$17</h5>
                    <p class="review-para">Oil Control, you say? Not so fast, TFS. I bought this to compare it to the Innisfree cushion, and I was disappointed. It does nothing to live up to its "oil control" claim. It doesn't even try. At all. Actually, this was one of the worst in that department. Another issue  with this cushion is that its application is a bit strange. The puff is peach colored instead of the usual blue, making it hard to tell how much product you're picking up. The product sticks to the puff, making application very patchy. The cushion itself is a bit different as well. It's much softer, but doesn't seem to release the product as willingly as typical cushions. Between the formula of this product and the puff, you get the worst finish of all the cushions I've tried.</p>

I believe the XP is supposed to be a bit better for oily skin, but I don't really notice a difference. I will say though, the XP smells like roses, and I'm all about that. But really, neither of these cushions last on my face for more than a few hours no matter what I do. Even the Missha is better in terms of longevity. All of that aside, I will say that the puffs that come with these cushions are perfect and the formula offers the best coverage of all the cushions I've tried. If you don't have oily skin, these are worth a shot.</p>

Is it perfect? No, I would love for it to last even longer, but all good things must come to an end, right? Overall, it's just a great cushion for the price. I'll keep buying refills for this one until death or cheaper cushion do us part.</p>
